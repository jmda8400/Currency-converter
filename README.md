# currency-converter
This project lets you convert between different currencies using an API.

## Getting Started

**Prerequisites**

First and foremost, you need a python based integrated development environment, such as [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/) or [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/es-es/pycharm/).
Thankfully, the only library we will need for this script (Tkinter) comes built-in with every Python installation.

## Built With

- [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html)
