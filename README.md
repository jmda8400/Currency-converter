# currency-converter
This project lets you convert between different currencies using an API.

## Getting Started

**Prerequisites**

First and foremost, you need a python based integrated development environment, such as [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/) or [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/es-es/pycharm/).
Thankfully, one of the fundamental libraries for the script (tkinter) comes built-in with every Python installation.
In order to install the other needed libraries, you need to open up your IDE's terminal and type the next commands:

```
pip install numpy
```
```
pip install matplotlib
```
